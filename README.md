Q11. Given a set of numbers like <10, 36, 54,89,12> we want to find sum of weights based on the following conditions
    1. 5 if a perfect square
    2. 4 if multiple of 4 and divisible by 6
    3. 3 if even number
And sort the numbers based on the weight and print it as follows
<10,its_weight>,<36,its weight><89,its weight>
Should display the numbers based on increasing order.
